#### Project Overview


This repository contains a simple CNN architecture that serves as a cornerstone for anyone interested in learning how to classify images, without diving into the complexities of more advanced models.

#### Features

- **Simplicity:** The codebase is designed to be as simple and readable as possible, ensuring that even those with minimal experience in neural networks can understand and use it.
- **Educational Value:** Aside from its practical application, this project serves as an educational tool, offering insights into the workings of convolutional neural networks and the process of image classification.
- **Foundation for Further Exploration:** While the model provided here is basic, it lays a solid foundation for experimenting and building more complex neural networks to handle broader image classification challenges.
